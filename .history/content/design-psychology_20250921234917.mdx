When I build products ,  whether it’s an AI-powered platform or a simple interface for kids ,  I always come back to the same truth: design is psychology. It’s not about colors, fonts, or fancy animations on their own. It’s about how humans think, feel, and act when they interact with your product.

Over time, I’ve boiled it down to five timeless rules. These aren’t buzzwords. They’re psychological laws that have been tested and proven for decades. And if you apply them consistently, you can create user experiences that feel natural, intuitive, and even delightful.

## Fitts’s Law ,  Big Button Good, Small Button Bad

The faster you want someone to act, the bigger and closer the target should be. That’s why the “submit” button should never be tiny, tucked into a corner. It should be obvious, tappable, and accessible.

Think about your phone. The keyboard keys aren’t microscopic for a reason. Fitts’s Law reminds us: if you want action, design for it.

## Hick’s Law ,  Cut the Noise

People freeze when you throw too many choices at them. Hick’s Law says the more options you add, the slower the decision-making.

That’s why your product shouldn’t look like an airport dashboard. Give people a few clear paths forward, not 20. Simplicity speeds things up.

## The Von Restorff Effect ,  Make the Important Thing Stand Out

Humans notice contrast. If everything looks the same, nothing gets attention. The Von Restorff Effect says the one thing that looks different will always stick in the mind.

That’s your call-to-action. That’s your “Buy Now,” your “Start Free Trial,” your “Go Live.” Don’t bury it. Make it pop.

## Occam’s Razor ,  Kill the Clutter

If something isn’t necessary, remove it. Complexity is seductive ,  it feels like more features = more value. In reality, more features often mean more confusion.

Occam’s Razor is a reminder: the simplest path is usually the best. Every extra click, extra button, extra word is a chance to lose your user.

## Weber’s Law ,  Don’t Sweat the Imperceptible

We notice big changes, not tiny tweaks. A button changing from #4FA3F7 to #4FA5F8 blue? Nobody cares. A whole new way to complete a task in half the time? That’s what gets noticed.

Weber’s Law keeps us honest: focus on the changes users actually feel.

## My Golden Rule

Every design choice must serve clarity, simplicity, and delight. If it doesn’t, it goes in the bin.

These aren’t just rules for designers. They’re rules for anyone who builds ,  whether you’re coding, sketching, or shaping a business strategy. Because at the end of the day, we’re all designing experiences for humans.

And humans run on psychology.
