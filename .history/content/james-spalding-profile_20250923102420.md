# James Spalding: Profile

Creative technologist and product builder turning vision into systems that feel inevitable.

## Professional Identity
I work at the intersection of design, code, and strategy, turning visions into working systems that feel intuitive and alive. With 12+ years across AI, software, entrepreneurship and product design, I thrive in fast‑moving environments where clarity does not yet exist and something new needs to be built.

## Core Approach
- AI‑native workflow: compress customer-focused research, prototyping, and delivery using cutting-edge tools like Cursor IDE, Vercel AI SDK, and modern generative models.
- Build to learn: ship the smallest useful version, iterate with real data and weekly demos.
- Jobs to be done as the north star: every screen, copy, and action maps to a job.
- Design and engineering move together: type, layout, and data models co‑evolve so "useful" feels inevitable.
- Facilitative leadership: structured workshops, sharp Project Briefs and Product Requirements Documents, crisp decisions, and collaborative ownership.
- Visual systems thinking: I use system diagrams, architecture maps, and sequence flows to quickly align teams and make complex systems understandable and actionable for everyone. These visual tools are not just documentation—they’re a shared language for design, engineering, and stakeholders to see the big picture and spot opportunities or risks early.

## Unique Strengths
1. Systems sense: constraints, interfaces, and incentives seen as one graph  
2. Full‑stack fluency: narrative to Figma to code to metrics  
3. Orchestration: compose tools, agents, and APIs into dependable workflows  
4. Taste: Eye for design, clarity, rhythm, impact; motion as feedback, not flair  
5. Advocacy: inclusion by default; accessibility and neurodiversity are core principles 

## What I am Best At
- Translate vision into testable scopes and day‑one demos  
- Reduce complex flows to a few obvious paths  
- Build evaluable systems with safe defaults, observability, and rollback  
- Keep pace high without breaking trust  


## Journey: What Selected Roles Taught Me
- Stealth AI Startups (Head of Product / CPO consultant): product‑led AI, own delivery end to end, facilitate workshops, scale cloud‑native systems, deepen AI context management and orchestration
- MiAI Law: ship fast to professionals, model legal research workflows, integrate automation that actually saves time, raise the bar on front‑end clarity
- MarketSizer: accelerate product with data, validate with users, tighten the value proposition and growth loops
- Emergegen AI: lead cross‑industry roadmaps, design sustainable product architecture, mentor teams on modern AI practices
- ESW: read trends, run executive workshops, shape strategy with evidence and clear stories
- Autism Innovation Strategy (Ireland): advocacy, public sector engagement, and inclusive policy thinking that grounds product choices in real impact
- Vstage: stand up an AR product line, run agile cadences, keep feasibility, UX, and momentum in balance
- Voalá Immersive Technology (founder): fundraise, own product end to end, build and scale a team, navigate early‑stage chaos with calm

## Signature Statement
I turn ambiguity into shippable clarity, blending design, AI, and engineering into products that work, read, and feel right.
