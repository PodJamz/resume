# Strengths & Role Fit ,  AI Product Lead (Agent Orchestration)

**Who I am in one line.** Systems analyst and product builder: map the current process, ship a clean V0, then add agentic automation only where guardrails and evaluation exist.

## Role fit (plain English)
- **Requirements → PRD:** Lead. Frame the problem, set success criteria, and write a usable PRD.
- **Design & UX:** Co‑lead with a designer; keep flows simple and reversible.
- **Agent orchestration & architecture:** Lead the first cut; pair with Staff MLE for experimentation, eval design, and model choices.
- **Full‑stack build & delivery:** Lead small builds; pair with Platform/DevOps for deployments, observability, and rollbacks.
- **Evaluation & guardrails:** Lead. Maintain weekly scorecards; ship behind flags; define kill‑switches.
- **Cost/FinOps & heavy infra:** Partner. Provide targets; let specialists own the levers.

## STAR snapshots (proof without numbers)
- **MarketSizer** ,  *S*: notes/opinions scattered. *T*: make sizing fast and clear. *A*: clone analyst flow; small planner with sources + one‑click charts; light checks. *R*: faster decisions with traceable assumptions.
- **Music AI** ,  *S*: risk of accidental audio reuse. *T*: month‑1 safety MVP. *A*: scope to one path; quick checks, clear overrides, respectful tone. *R*: safer sessions without slowing work.
- **ESW** ,  *S*: discovery→delivery drift. *T*: keep the story intact. *A*: workshops → one‑page plan → weekly demos + light eval. *R*: calmer launches, tighter reviews.
- **MiAI Law** ,  *S*: drafting needed sources & safety. *T*: prove approach, exit cleanly. *A*: retrieval w/ citations; checkpoints; handover doc. *R*: trust improved; team had a clear path.

## Platform rules (kept simple)
- One place to manage models and versions.
- One simple way for apps to call any model.
- Background jobs separate from live requests.
- Risky changes start on a small slice; quick rollback.
- Basic dashboards/alerts to see problems early.
