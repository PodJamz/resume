# James Spalding – Signature Strengths Profile

## Professional Identity
**Creative Technologist & Product Builder**  
I work at the intersection of design, code, and strategy, turning visions into working systems that feel intuitive and alive. With 12+ years across AI, software, and product design, I thrive in fast-moving environments where clarity doesn’t yet exist and something new needs to be built.

## Core Approach
- **AI-Native & Product-Led** – I use the latest AI tools (Cursor IDE, Vercel AI SDK, generative models) to accelerate learning, prototyping, and delivery.  
- **Hands-On & Iterative** – I learn by doing, rapidly turning concepts into MVPs and iterating with real user feedback.  
- **Jobs-to-Be-Done Focused** – I frame every build around solving real problems for real people.  
- **Design + Engineering Fusion** – I make products that not only work but also feel right, clear, elegant, and human-centered.  
- **Collaborative Leadership** – I lead through deep listening, facilitation, and co-creation, multiplying the productivity of those around me.  

## Unique Strengths
1. **Systems Thinking** – See the full architecture: technical, product, and business layers interconnected.  
2. **Cross-Disciplinary Fluency** – Move fluidly between strategy decks, product roadmaps, and code commits.  
3. **Rapid Prototyping & Orchestration** – Build and validate quickly, orchestrating AI, workflows, and multi-agent systems.  
4. **Design Sensibility** – Strong aesthetic judgment; products look and feel alive, not just functional.  
5. **Adaptability** – Proven track record across industries (LegalTech, MedTech, Finance, AR/VR, Education, AI Research).  
6. **Inclusive Advocacy** – Champion for accessibility and neurodiversity, linking product impact to real-world change.  

## What I’m Best At
- Translating visionary ideas into actionable, testable MVPs.  
- Building AI-native, user-centered products that deliver real value fast.  
- Orchestrating teams and technologies into coherent, scalable systems.  
- Balancing **creativity + pragmatism** to keep projects both inspiring and grounded.  

## Journey: what each role taught me
- **Stealth AI Startups (Head of Product/CPO consultant)**: product-led AI, own delivery end to end, facilitate workshops, scale cloud-native systems, deepen AI context management and orchestration.
- **MiAI Law**: ship fast to professionals, model legal research workflows, integrate automation that actually saves time, raise the bar on front-end clarity.
- **MarketSizer**: accelerate product with data, validate with users, tighten the value proposition and growth loops.
- **Emergegen AI**: lead cross-industry roadmaps, design sustainable product architecture, mentor teams on modern AI practices.
- **ESW**: read trends, run executive workshops, shape strategy with evidence and clear stories.
- **Autism Innovation Strategy (Ireland)**: advocacy, public sector engagement, and inclusive policy thinking that grounds product choices in real impact.
- **Vstage**: stand up an AR product line, run agile cadences, keep feasibility, UX, and momentum in balance.
- **Voalá Immersive Technology (founder)**: fundraise, own product end to end, build and scale a team, navigate early-stage chaos with calm.
- **NICB (DCU)**: reliability, compliance, and process improvement in high-stakes environments.
- **TOMRA Sorting Food**: international business development, market research, and adapting strategy to new cultures.
- **Financial Way Group**: negotiation and contract rigor, manage risk and compliance across borders.
- **Pracatum**: communicate complex ideas simply, design technology-enabled learning that meets people where they are.
- **ReLOVEution**: creative direction and event operations; coordinate teams and deliver experiences end to end.

This sequence is why I move comfortably from ambiguity to shipped systems. Each step taught me the next constraint to respect and the next lever to pull.

## Signature Statement
**I turn ambiguity into clarity, and vision into reality, blending design, AI, and strategy into products that solve real problems and feel alive.**
