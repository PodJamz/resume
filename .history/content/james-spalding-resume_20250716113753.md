## Summary

Bilingual Creative Technologist and Product Designer/Builder/Developer/Engineer/Architect who loves to superpower my workflow using the latest AI powered tools such as Cursor IDE. For over 12 years, I’ve specialized in translating ambitious founder and visionary product ideas—often complex and abstract—into clear technical requirements and real, customer-driven products. I thrive on collaborating with highly driven teams to turn vision into MVPs and scalable solutions, using a product-led, jobs-to-be-done, and value proposition-driven approach. My process is hands-on and iterative: I facilitate workshops, work closely with stakeholders to define the real jobs to be done, and lead teams to deliver value to users in the fewest steps possible. I believe the best products are built through a blend of technical excellence, deep listening, and collaborative problem-solving—always keeping the user’s needs and the business’s goals at the center. I’m at my best when I’m helping turn vision into reality, building what’s next, and making sure every step solves a real problem for real people.
