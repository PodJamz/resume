## Summary

Bilingual Creative Technologist with 12+ years of experience spanning Entrepreneurship and Startups, AI, Product Management and Strategy, Software Development, and business growth.

Back in 2018, during my son's first year, I made the decision to align my career with my passions and values, striving to build meaningful technology and solve real-world problems. I'm mission-driven and left my job as a Facilities Engineer to dive headfirst into startups and technology. I founded Voalá Immersive Technology, where I led product vision and development, delivering innovative AR solutions, and have since worked in multiple early-stage startups in Ireland and abroad. I excel at guiding startup product development, delivering practical AI-powered solutions, and fostering strong collaboration across diverse teams. Currently, I'm consulting as Head of Product/CPO in multiple stealth startups spanning multiple areas in AI. I specialize in user-centered design, refined front-end development, and creating strategic plans that scale across international markets.
