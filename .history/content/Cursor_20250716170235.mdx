Lately, I’ve been noticing a wave of founders referring to their new tools as “Cursor for design” or “Cursor for video” in their marketing. It’s become shorthand in the dev and tech community—Cursor is the reference point for AI-native tools that plug directly into your workflow, where code and conversation are one.

That’s cool. But here’s the thing: I don’t just use [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so) for coding.

I can use Cursor for everything.

✦ **Real-time collaboration — no waiting on files**

When I’m working with a founder or team to prepare for a pitch, maybe a deck, a value prop session, or a full Product Architecture workshop, I’ll run the whole process inside Cursor. 

The live session is where the real magic happens:

- We draft the slides, the story, the framing, in real time.
- Everyone's watching the same markdown doc evolve, the same live site get changes pushed to it, or live webpage in HTML that’s screen shared as it updates with everyone’s input.
- I’m editing directly in Cursor, live on the call.
- We’re pushing ideas into final form as we discuss.
- No one’s saying “can you send that to me later?”, they’ve already seen it, shaped it, and it’s done.

You could run this on Notion, or Google Docs, or some Microsoft product, but nah... once you’ve felt Cursor as a real-time doc builder, with smart suggestions, versioning, chat history, and live coding all in one, there’s no going back.

✦ **Workshop mode: Build, write, sketch, collaboratively and fluidly**

Say we’re mapping out product ideas. I’ve got Excalidraw open on one side for sketching diagrams. In Cursor, I’m turning that into structured markdown, HTML web page/documents for live preview, or whatever else we need.

- The diagram becomes an interactive prototype.
- The notes become the front end.
- The brainstorm becomes a working app.

Sometimes I’ll even layer in audio input to voice prompt, speak my intent while screen-sharing—and the whole team watches Cursor updating based on our feedback, then refresh the page and boom. Vibe coding live with a team on call? It's fun, collaborative and fast.

✦ **One brain, one space**

Whether it’s:
- Architecting a full-stack product
- Drafting an onboarding sequence
- Building out a docs site
- Prepping a founder for a pitch
- Or just aligning async on priorities

…I run it all through Cursor.

You can keep hopping from tool to tool—or you can just stay in flow, inside one intelligent environment that’s already learned your context.

I’m not using Cursor “for X.”
I’m using Cursor for everything.

And when it’s set up right, it feels less like a tool and more like a creative space. A live co-founder that doesn’t sleep.
