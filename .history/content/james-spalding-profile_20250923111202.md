Creative technologist and product leader turning vision into systems that feel inevitable.

## Professional Identity
I work at the intersection of design, code, and strategy, turning visions into intuitive, living systems. With 12+ years across AI, software, entrepreneurship, and product design, I thrive in fast-moving environments where clarity is absent and new solutions must be built.

## Core Approach
- Compress customer-focused research, prototyping, and delivery using tools like Cursor IDE, Vercel AI SDK, and generative models.  
- Ship the smallest useful version, iterate with real data and weekly demos.  
- Anchor every screen, copy, and action to a clear job to be done.  
- Co-evolve type, layout, and data models so "useful" feels inevitable.  
- Facilitate with structured workshops, sharp briefs, crisp decisions, and collaborative ownership.  
- Visualize systems with diagrams, architecture maps, and flows to align teams and surface risks early.

## Unique Strengths
1. Systems sense: view constraints, interfaces, and incentives as a unified graph  
2. Full-stack fluency: move fluidly from narrative to design, code, and metrics  
3. Orchestration: compose tools, agents, MCPs, and APIs into reliable workflows  
4. Taste: eye for design, clarity, rhythm, and restraint  
5. Advocacy: embed inclusion, accessibility, and neurodiversity as core principles

## What I am Best At
- Translate vision into demos from day one  
- Simplify complex flows into obvious paths  
- Track scope in a single system of record with role-based loops for evaluable builds—safe defaults, observability, and rollback ready  
- Maintain high velocity without breaking trust

## Journey: What Selected Roles Taught Me
- Stealth AI Startups (Head of Product / CPO consultant): lead product-led AI, own end-to-end delivery, facilitate workshops, scale cloud-native systems, deepen AI context management and orchestration  
- MiAI Law: ship fast to professionals, model legal workflows, integrate time-saving automation, raise front-end clarity  
- MarketSizer: accelerate product with data, validate with users, tighten value proposition and growth loops  
- Emergegen AI: lead cross-industry roadmaps, design sustainable architecture, mentor on modern AI practices  
- ESW: read trends, run executive workshops, shape strategy with evidence and clear stories  
- Autism Innovation Strategy (Ireland): advocacy, stakeholder engagement in the public sector, contributing to national policy and innovation choices which have real impact on peoples lives.  
- Vstage: launch AR product line, run agile cadences, balance feasibility, UX, and momentum  
- Voalá Immersive Technology (founder): fundraise, own product end-to-end, build and scale team, navigate early-stage chaos with calm

## Signature Statement
I turn ambiguity into clear, working products that blend design, AI, and engineering seamlessly.
