    "Bilingual creative technologist and Product Builder passionate about superpowered AI workflows that bring visions to reality through innovative technology.",
  summary: `Bilingual Creative Technologist and Product Designer/Builder/Developer/Engineer/Architect who loves to superpower my workflow using the latest AI powered tools such as Cursor IDE.

Over 12+ years, Iâ€™ve gradually specialized in a range of disciplines (design, engineering, product, and AI) so I can deliver more value in a technology landscape thatâ€™s always evolving. My approach is to learn by doing: with each project and role, Iâ€™ve added new skills to my toolkit, always focused on solving real problems for real people.

I thrive on collaborating with highly driven teams to turn vision into MVPs and scalable solutions, using a product-led, jobs-to-be-done, and value proposition-driven approach.

My process is hands-on and iterative: I facilitate workshops, work closely with stakeholders to define the real jobs to be done, and lead teams to deliver value to users in the fewest steps possible.

I believe the best products are built through a blend of technical excellence, deep listening, and collaborative problem-solving, always keeping the userâ€™s needs and the businessâ€™s goals at the center. Iâ€™m at my best when Iâ€™m helping turn vision into reality, building whatâ€™s next, and making sure every step solves a real problem for real people.

Iâ€™m currently very fascinated by rapid prototyping, AI context management, and orchestrating collaborative product development with the latest tools, always seeking new ways to deliver value faster and smarter.`,
