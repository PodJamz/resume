  summary:
    "Back in 2018, during my son's first year, I became determined to do him proud by doing what I love. I quit my job as a Facilities Engineer and dove headfirst into startups and technology. I went on to build Voalá Immersive Technology (an AR startup) and have since worked in multiple early-stage startups in Ireland and abroad. I hold a Postgraduate Degree in Software Entrepreneurship & Startup Creation and thrive leading startup product development, building AI-driven solutions, and driving cross-functional collaboration. Currently, I'm working as Head of Product in a stealth startup in Medical AI. I'm also developing IAMAI, an to give AI superpowers to all. I especially enjoy working on user-centric design, front-end development, and strategic planning for global markets.",
