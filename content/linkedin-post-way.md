# LinkedIn Quick Post - Way Project

Just shipped **Way** 🌊 — a contemplative AI experience inspired by Lao Tzu where you can speak or type what's on your mind and get reflective responses, while a living water simulation moves behind the words like a quiet companion.

It started after a conversation with [Wenmin Sun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wenmin-sun-ab040326b/) about the Tao. I thought: "Hey, I should put something together to make it easy to consult the wisdom of the Tao." And hey presto, here we have it.

Built with streaming responses (Vercel AI SDK), voice AI (browser-native speech-to-text and text-to-speech), RAG to keep reflections grounded in the Tao Te Ching, and real-time WebGPU water simulation.

Shoutout to the [Voice AI Space](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/voice-ai-space/) — T-Bot is the best community owner in this niche and always keeps me up to date on everything Voice AI. This project wouldn't have been the same without the inspiration and knowledge from that community.
