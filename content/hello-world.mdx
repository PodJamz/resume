I am thrilled to share with you a glimpse into my upcoming book, "Neurodiversity & AI: Down the Rabbit Hole." This book takes you on my journey of exploration, delving into the fascinating world where neurodiversity intersects with artificial intelligence (AI) and its profound impact on society. Essentially the story of my life currently as these are two areas which I am currently very immersed in.

In our quest for a more inclusive and diverse world, it is crucial to recognize the inherent value in embracing different perspectives, experiences, and abilities. With the emergence of AI technology, we now have an unprecedented opportunity to reimagine diversity and its relationship with innovation, progress, and positive change.

"Neurodiversity & AI: Down the Rabbit Hole" guides you through the concept of neurodiversity, which acknowledges the natural variation in human cognition and celebrates different cognitive styles and abilities. We also dive into AI, exploring its potential to support and empower neurodiverse individuals, and how it influences our understanding of diversity.

Throughout the book, we embark on a captivating exploration, combining research, personal experiences, and compelling case studies. We delve into the challenges and opportunities that arise when we unite neurodiversity and AI, paving the way for more inclusive and innovative solutions that benefit society as a whole.
