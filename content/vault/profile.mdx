# James Spalding — Systems Analyst & Developer; Product Builder (AI Platforms)

**Deck sentence.** I map messy processes and ship simple, reliable software—scope → PRD → design → build—then add safe, evaluable automation.

**Short bio.** End-to-end operator: turn ambiguity into a month‑1 MVP, keep scope honest, and layer agents only where guardrails & evals exist. Calm, checklist-driven delivery.

## Focus
Agent orchestration • PRDs & storylines • Process mapping • Evaluation & guardrails • Full‑stack delivery • Observability

## Selected impact
- **MarketSizer:** turned scattered market notes into a clear sizing tool with traceable assumptions and one‑click charts.
- **Music AI:** scoped a copyright‑safety MVP to one risk path; shipped a month‑1 demo artists could test and override.
- **ESW:** workshops → one‑page plan → weekly demos; discovery flowed into delivery without hype.
- **MiAI Law:** assistive drafting with citations and checkpoints; month‑1 prototype and clean handover.
- **Evaluation:** light tests and scorecards so changes don’t slip backwards.
- **Design:** cleaner screens, safer defaults, plain words people trust.

## Platform rules (plain English)
- One place to manage models and versions.
- One simple way for apps to call any model.
- Keep background jobs separate from live requests.
- Try risky changes on a small slice first; quick rollback.
- Basic dashboards/alerts to see problems early.
