Way is a contemplative AI experience inspired by Lao Tzu. You arrive, you speak or type what's on your mind, and you get a reflective response—while a living "water surface" moves behind the words like a quiet companion. Try it here: [way-lovat.vercel.app](https://way-lovat.vercel.app).

This is the story of the tech we used to make it feel simple.

## The experience we wanted

Most AI chat apps feel like forms: type → submit → wait. Way aims for something softer:

- **Immediate, streaming replies** (so it feels like a conversation, not a page load)
- **Optional voice** (so you can speak thoughts that don't want typing)
- **Grounded tone** (so it doesn't drift into generic "internet wisdom")
- **Ambient water** (so the UI feels like a place, not a tool)

## Next.js — the "home" for everything

We built Way with Next.js (App Router) so the UI and server logic can live together cleanly:

- The app renders the interface and handles routing.
- Server endpoints handle chat streaming and voice-related requests.
- It deploys cleanly to production without complicated infrastructure.

## Vercel AI SDK — streaming that feels alive

The biggest "feel" upgrade is streaming: the assistant's reply appears as it's being generated.

That tiny difference changes the vibe from "submit a ticket" to "someone is responding." It also keeps the app feeling fast even when the model takes a moment.

## RAG — keeping the reflection anchored

A philosophical voice can easily become vague. To keep Way grounded, we use RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):

- We chunk the Tao Te Ching text
- Create embeddings for each chunk
- On each user message, we retrieve the most relevant passages
- Then we feed those passages as "context to reflect on," so the response stays close to the source

This is how Way can feel more like it's drawing from a real text—without turning every answer into a quotation dump.

## Convex — the backend brain (including vector search)

Convex powers the backend pieces that make RAG and data workflows practical:

- Actions/mutations/queries to orchestrate ingestion + search
- Vector storage + vector search to retrieve relevant passages quickly
- A solid foundation to expand persistence later (without overbuilding upfront)

## Voice — using the browser's native speech tools

Way supports voice through browser capabilities:

- Speech-to-text to capture what you say
- Text-to-speech (where supported) to speak the reflection back

The goal isn't "voice assistant" energy—it's more like speaking into still water and hearing it answer.

## WebGPU + WGSL — the water isn't a video, it's real-time graphics

The Waterball background is powered by WebGPU, with shaders written in WGSL. That gives us:

- Real-time simulation/rendering on the GPU
- A visual layer that feels organic and responsive
- A calm ambient presence that supports (rather than distracts from) the conversation

### Credit: Waterball inspiration (and source project)

The Waterball simulation work that inspired this integration is credited to [matsuoka-601](https://github.com/matsuoka-601) and their open-source WaterBall project, "Real-time fluid simulation on a sphere implemented in WebGPU."

## Why this stack worked

We picked tech that supports the feeling of the product:

- Next.js for a clean full-stack app surface
- Vercel AI SDK for streaming conversation
- OpenAI + RAG for grounded, less-generic reflections
- Convex for vector search and backend workflows
- WebGPU for a living background that makes the experience memorable
- Browser speech APIs for voice that removes friction
